Leader Influence Dashboard — Product Brief
1) What does “influence” mean on Sway?

On Sway, influence is not popularity. Popularity signals interest, but influence exists only when that interest can be credibly deployed in real elections.

Sway is built to convert social alignment into deployable voting power: verified voters, tied to jurisdictions, mapped to real ballot items on real election dates. If popularity alone were sufficient, Sway wouldn’t need verification or ballot infrastructure.

Definition: Influence on Sway is a leader’s ability to credibly shape electoral decisions by organizing verified voters in the jurisdictions and elections where those decisions are made.

Influence emerges when a leader’s network satisfies four conditions:

Credibility: supporters are verified, eligible voters

Context: those voters intersect with specific ballot items (races/measures)

Concentration: support is focused in the same places and time windows (e.g., an upcoming election)

Growth capacity: influence compounds through recruiting, verification conversion, and supporters becoming leaders

In product terms: Popularity = potential energy. Influence = kinetic energy.
This dashboard exists to show leaders where influence is real today, and what to do next to grow it.

2) Which 3–5 metrics matter most?

These metrics are computable from the provided data, actionable for leaders, and honest about what can be claimed today.

1. Verified Voter Base + Growth

Verified voters aligned with the leader

Growth over time (e.g., weekly/monthly)

Verification rate (% of supporters verified)

Why: verified voters are the foundation of credible leverage; growth is a leading indicator of movement health.

2. Jurisdiction Concentration

Verified voters by jurisdiction

Concentration summary (e.g., top jurisdiction share; optionally an HHI-style index)

Why: influence depends on density—concentrated support produces leverage; diffuse support indicates reach/potential but is harder to deploy.

3. Ballot Exposure

For each ballot item: # of verified voters who will see it

Ranked and grouped by election date and jurisdiction

Why: influence is only real where your people can vote on a concrete decision.

4. Urgency-Weighted Influence

Ballot exposure weighted by time-to-election (e.g., <30 days, 30–90, 90+)

Why: leaders need to prioritize what matters now, not just what matters eventually.

5. Network Expansion Signal
of supporters who become leaders

New jurisdictions reached via connected leaders (where possible)

Why: durable influence compounds through organizer networks, not just follower counts.

3) What insights and actions should the dashboard enable?

This dashboard is prescriptive, not just descriptive. It should let a leader answer:

Where does my influence actually exist right now?

Which upcoming elections/races/measures matter most to my network?

What should I do this week to increase leverage?

“This Week’s Focus” (primary UX)

Auto-surface 3–5 prioritized actions, each tied to a metric shift:

High-urgency, high-exposure ballot items → “Publish a voter guide + mobilize supporters here”

Strong jurisdictions with low verification rate → “Run a targeted verification push”

High concentration risk → “Expand into adjacent jurisdictions before you’re fragile”

Low network expansion → “Recruit chapter leaders from engaged supporters”

Success criterion: a leader opens the dashboard and immediately knows the top few moves to make this week.

4) What’s out of scope (and why)?

To stay accurate, neutral, and stage-appropriate, this MVP explicitly avoids:

Predicting election outcomes
Requires turnout history and competitiveness modeling; introduces forecasting and liability risk.

Persuasion / vote switching measurement
Sway tracks alignment and organization, not opinion change.

Individual-level targeting or micro-profiling
Focus is aggregate, privacy-preserving influence—not voter surveillance.

Competitive leader “rankings” as a primary incentive
Risks incentivizing popularity; this dashboard prioritizes actionable leverage over leaderboard dynamics.

These are intentionally deferred to protect trust, accuracy, and product focus while the platform scales.
