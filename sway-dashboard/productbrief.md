# Leader Influence Dashboard — Product Brief

## 1. What does “influence” mean on Sway?

On Sway, **influence is not popularity**. Popularity represents interest or alignment, but influence only exists when that interest can be **credibly deployed in real elections**.

If popularity alone were sufficient, Sway would not need voter verification, jurisdictions, ballot items, or election data. Instead, Sway is explicitly designed to transform social alignment into **deployable voting power**.

**Influence on Sway is defined as a leader’s ability to credibly shape real electoral decisions by organizing verified voters in the jurisdictions and elections where those decisions are made.**

A leader with 10,000 supporters who cannot vote in the same election has less influence than a leader with 500 verified voters concentrated in a decisive local race. Influence emerges when a leader’s supporter network meets four conditions:

* **Credibility**: supporters are verified, eligible voters
* **Context**: those voters can act on specific ballot items (races or measures)
* **Concentration**: support is focused geographically and temporally
* **Growth capacity**: the network can compound through recruitment, verification, and new leaders

In product terms:

* **Popularity = potential energy**
* **Influence = kinetic energy**

The Leader Influence Dashboard exists to show leaders **where their potential turns into real political leverage**, and how to grow it.

## 2. Which 3–5 metrics matter most?

The dashboard focuses on metrics that are **measurable from existing data**, **actionable for leaders**, and **honest about what Sway can claim today**.

### 1. Verified Voter Base (and Growth Rate)

* Count of verified voters aligned with the leader
* Trend over time (growth velocity)

**Why it matters:** Verification is the foundation of credible influence. Growth rate is a leading indicator of movement health.

---

### 2. Jurisdiction Concentration Index

* Distribution of verified voters across jurisdictions
* Share of total voters concentrated in top jurisdictions

**Why it matters:** Influence depends on density. Concentrated support creates leverage; diffuse support creates potential.

---

### 3. Ballot Exposure by Race / Measure

* Number of verified voters who will see each ballot item
* Ranked by exposure, grouped by upcoming elections

**Why it matters:** Influence only exists where voters intersect with real decisions. This metric translates supporters into concrete electoral leverage.

---

### 4. Urgency-Weighted Influence

* Ballot exposure weighted by time-to-election
* Near-term elections prioritized over distant ones

**Why it matters:** Influence is time-bound. Leaders need to know where to focus *now* versus where they are building long-term power.

---

### 5. Network Expansion Signal

* Supporters who become leaders
* New jurisdictions unlocked through derivative leaders

**Why it matters:** Durable influence compounds through organizer networks, not just follower counts.

---

## 3. What insights and actions should the dashboard enable?

The dashboard is **prescriptive, not just descriptive**. It should help leaders answer:

* *Where does my influence actually exist right now?*
* *Which elections and ballot items matter most to my network?*
* *Where should I invest time and outreach next?*

Examples of insights → actions:

* **Insight:** 68% of verified voters are concentrated in two jurisdictions with elections in the next 60 days
  **Action:** Prioritize voter guides and recruitment campaigns in those jurisdictions

* **Insight:** A local race has high supporter exposure but low verification rate
  **Action:** Run a targeted verification push for supporters in that district

* **Insight:** Network growth is plateauing in core jurisdictions
  **Action:** Encourage trusted supporters to form new groups and expand into adjacent areas

The dashboard should make it obvious **what to do this week**, not just what is true.

---

## 4. What’s out of scope (and why)?

To remain accurate, neutral, and stage-appropriate, the following are explicitly out of scope for this MVP:

* **Predicting election outcomes**
  Requires historical turnout data and introduces forecasting and liability concerns

* **Persuasion or vote-switching measurement**
  Sway tracks alignment and organization, not opinion change

* **Individual-level targeting or micro-profiling**
  The focus is aggregate, privacy-preserving influence, not voter targeting

* **Cross-leader competitive benchmarking**
  Requires multi-leader datasets and risks incentivizing popularity over meaningful leverage

These capabilities are intentionally deferred to protect trust, accuracy, and focus while Sway builds toward scale.

---

**Summary:**
The Leader Influence Dashboard translates Sway’s core promise — *Vote with people you trust to create real political power* — into a concrete, decision-making tool. It shows leaders where their network’s potential becomes real influence, and how to grow that influence responsibly over time.
