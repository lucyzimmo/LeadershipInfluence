# Leader Influence Dashboard — Product Brief

## 1. What does "influence" mean on Sway?

On Sway, influence is not popularity. Popularity signals interest, but influence exists only when that interest can be credibly deployed in real elections. Sway converts social alignment into deployable voting power by tying verified voters to jurisdictions, ballot items, and election timelines.

**Definition:** Influence on Sway is a leader's ability to shape electoral decisions by organizing verified voters in the jurisdictions and elections where those decisions occur.

Influence emerges when a network has:
- **Credibility**: Verified voters who can actually vote
- **Context**: Overlap with real ballot items and elections
- **Concentration**: Focused in the same places and time windows
- **Growth capacity**: Verification conversion and supporters becoming leaders themselves

The dashboard makes this influence visible, measurable, and actionable—turning abstract "support" into concrete electoral leverage.

## 2. Which metrics matter most?

### Core Influence Metrics

**Verified Voter Base + Growth**
- Total verified voters (the foundation of credible leverage)
- Growth trends over time (weekly/monthly rates)
- Verification rate (% of supporters who are verified)
- Growth velocity and projections (30/90 day forecasts)

**Jurisdiction Concentration**
- Distribution of verified voters by jurisdiction
- Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) measuring geographic concentration
- Top jurisdictions by verified voter count and percentage
- Concentration risk assessment (high concentration = fragility)

**Ballot Exposure & Leverage**
- Number of verified voters eligible for each ballot item
- Leverage scores combining office level, time-to-election, and voter count
- Urgency classification (high/medium/low based on days until election)
- Leverage levels (kingmaker, significant, marginal) indicating potential impact

**Network Expansion**
- Connected leaders (supporters who lead their own groups)
- New jurisdictions unlocked through connected leaders
- Potential leaders (verified supporters who could start groups)
- Network depth vs. breadth metrics

**Topic-Level Intelligence**
- Multi-viewpoint group analysis (supporters, verified voters, jurisdictions per topic)
- Topic-specific growth trends and engagement metrics
- Cross-topic ballot item opportunities
- Topic concentration and expansion potential

**Movement Velocity**
- Growth rate (supporters per week)
- Trend direction (accelerating, steady, slowing)
- Peer benchmarking (when API data available)
- Projections for 30/90 day horizons

## 3. What insights and actions should the dashboard enable?

The dashboard is **prescriptive, not descriptive**. Leaders should immediately understand where their influence exists, which elections matter most, and what actions to take next.

### "This Week's Focus" — Automated Priority Actions

The dashboard automatically surfaces 3–5 prioritized actions based on:
1. **High-urgency, high-exposure ballot items** → "Publish a voter guide + mobilize supporters here"
2. **Strong jurisdictions with low verification rate** → "Run a targeted verification push"
3. **High concentration risk** → "Expand into adjacent jurisdictions before you're fragile"
4. **Low network expansion** → "Recruit chapter leaders from engaged supporters"
5. **Medium-urgency races with significant leverage** → "Research candidates and start building endorsement case"

Each action includes:
- Clear title and description
- Relevant metrics (leverage scores, verification rates, etc.)
- Specific recommended action
- Impact level (high/medium/low)

### Contextual Intelligence

**Election Influence List**
- All upcoming ballot items with verified supporter counts
- Sorted by urgency and leverage score
- Office level indicators (federal/state/local)
- Candidate information and measure summaries
- Filterable by election date, jurisdiction, and type

**Geographic Visualization**
- Interactive map showing jurisdiction concentration
- Top jurisdictions with verified voter counts
- Concentration risk indicators

**Leader Comparison & Benchmarks**
- Performance comparison against similar leaders (API-enhanced)
- Verification rate benchmarks
- Growth rate percentiles
- Contextual performance indicators without competitive rankings

**Coalition Opportunities** (API-enhanced)
- Potential partnerships with aligned leaders
- Shared jurisdictions and ballot items
- Synergy scores based on overlap and complementarity
- Partnership recommendations for coordinated action

**Topic Analysis**
- Multi-viewpoint group performance breakdown
- Topic-specific supporter and verified voter counts
- Recent joiners (30/90 day trends)
- Top jurisdictions per topic

**Supporter Engagement**
- Engagement metrics and trends
- Verification conversion rates
- Network expansion indicators

Success means a leader can open the dashboard and know exactly what to do this week—not just what happened last month.

## 4. What's out of scope?

The MVP explicitly avoids:

**Election Outcome Prediction**
- We don't predict who will win elections
- We measure where verified voters exist, not how they'll vote
- We avoid claims about electoral outcomes

**Persuasion or Vote-Switching Measurement**
- We don't measure how leaders change minds
- We focus on organizing existing supporters, not converting opponents
- We don't track individual voter preferences or voting history

**Individual Voter Targeting**
- Privacy-first: we aggregate at jurisdiction/ballot item level
- No individual voter profiles or targeting recommendations
- No voter contact information or direct outreach tools

**Competitive Leader Rankings**
- We provide contextual benchmarks, not leaderboards
- We avoid gamification that incentivizes popularity over impact
- Comparisons are for learning, not competition

**Long-Term Electoral Forecasting**
- Strategic horizon is ~6 months (upcoming elections)
- We don't model multi-year electoral cycles
- We focus on actionable near-term opportunities

These exclusions are intentional. They require additional data, introduce risk, or conflict with Sway's neutrality and privacy principles. They are deferred while the platform scales and builds trust.
